Final paper and pptx with audio recording is included. I cannot upload the mp4 of the presentation here because it is too big. The voiceover for each slide is on the left of each slide. You can also export the individual powerpoint to mp4 with the recordings tab and it'll make the mp4 for you.

Each of the training files can be run individuall in their current state. However if you want to run all 4 training files just run the main.py file. Make sure that the dataset is local to the folder the repo is cloned into. I put the Prime_FULL folder here at least to let you know that the dataset should be contained within there.
